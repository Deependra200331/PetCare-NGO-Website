# PetCare-NGO-Website
I built a PetCare NGO website as a full-stack project to create a simple and effective platform that connects pet lovers, adopters, and donors with the NGO. For the front end, I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5 to design a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface. On the back end, I worked with Python and Django to manage user authentication, dynamic content, databases, and overall server-side logic. The website includes useful features like pet adoption listings, donation forms, volunteer registration, and an admin panel for smooth content management. Through this project, I not only improved my front-end and back-end development skills but also learned how to bring everything together into a complete, real-world web application with a meaningful social impact.
